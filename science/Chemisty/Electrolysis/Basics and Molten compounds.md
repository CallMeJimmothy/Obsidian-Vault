splitting up with electricity

by using battery to pass electric current through the electrolyte (lead bromide in this case) it can be done to separate the lead and the bromide

Done by the negative bromide ions (Br<sup>-</sup>) being attracted to the positive Anode which then turns into a Discharged ion -> into a neutral atom, then resulting in then pairing into a gas (Bromine Gas) which then floats off

While the lead ions (Pb<sup>2+</sup>) becomes discharged to become pure lead which then sinks to form a layer of molten lead.

```
Key point:
at the cathodes the ions are being oxidised and reduced
Cathode -> reduced
Anode -> oxidised
```

Half equations
$$2br^- \overset{\text{Oxidised}}{\longrightarrow} Br_2 + 2e^-$$
$$Pb^2+ 2e^-\overset{\text{Reduced}}{\longrightarrow} Pb$$

What's actually happening:
	electrons from bromide -> Anode which travel through wire using battery to the Cathode -> lead ions which then turns into pure neutral lead
	
Equipment needed for electrolysis to be done:
	
	beaker
	electrolyte (liquid or solution that contains ionic compound)
		- for soluble (e.g CuSO<sub>4</sub> ) can dissolve in just water
		- for insoluble will need to be melted into molten liquid (e.g lead bromide)
	
	electrodes:
		-which are solid conductors (usually made out of metal or carbon)
		- Positive (Anode)
		- Negative (Cathode)

	and wire so electrons can flow (hooked up to power supply)
