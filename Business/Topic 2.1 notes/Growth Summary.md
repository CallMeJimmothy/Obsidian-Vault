# Business and Globalisation & International Trade

[[2.1 rev 4.jpg]]

## Globalisation

Globalisation is where businesses operate internationally and gain a lot of influence or power. Global changes the way businesses operate and creates new opportunities and threats.

### The impact of globalisation
Globalisation affects businesses in three main ways:
- **Imports**: Globalisation allows businesses to import products and raw materials at lower prices than those available in the UK, either for resale or to produce their own goods
- **Exports**: Exporting opens up new international markets to UK businesses and gives them the potential to grow. However, operating in international markets can be very difficult if they lack the necessary expertise or knowledge
- **Location**: Globalisation brings with it the opportunity for UK businesses to move their businesses to countries where it may be cheaper to produce materials or sell their products

### Multinationals
A multinational is a large company with facilities and markets around the world. They can provide benefits like creating jobs and growth when they enter a country. However, smaller local businesses can lose out, especially in less economically developed countries (LEDCs).

### Benefits and drawbacks of globalisation for businesses
**Benefits:**
- New market opportunities
- Access to technology and resources
- Greater influence on decision-making by external stakeholders

**Drawbacks:**
- Threat from foreign competitors
- Challenge of adapting products and services to meet the needs of foreign consumers

## International Trade

International trade is the exchange of goods and services between countries. Free trade is when there are no barriers to trade between countries. However, some governments take actions that restrict the flow of imports into their country. This is known as protectionism.

### Trade Barriers
- **Tariffs**: Tax on imports
- **Quotas**: Limits on imports
- **Subsidies**: Money given to help domestic producers
- **Non-tariff barriers**: Imposing quality or safety standards

### Reasons for trade barriers
- Protecting jobs in domestic industries
- Protecting emerging (infant) industries
- Preventing the dumping of cheap goods on the domestic market and the entry of undesirable goods
- Raising revenue through tariffs

### Trade Blocs
A trade barrier to international trade is a trade bloc. A trade bloc is created when governments of different countries agree to act together to promote trade among themselves. These agreements give preferential treatment to other countries within the trade bloc, to encourage trade between the countries.

Examples include:
- The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
- The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
