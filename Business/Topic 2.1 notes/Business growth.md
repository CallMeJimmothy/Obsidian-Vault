Once a business is established and successful, most owners will want it to grow. There are multiple approaches to growth with many differences between them.

## Internal Growth (Organic Growth)

When a business grows through their own efforts such as a trend of selling higher output over time. Business growth is often an important objective because it may:
- Help to increase market share
- Lead to lower costs
- Result in more profit

### Methods of Internal Growth:
- **Entering new markets** - changing the marketing mix to find new markets or expanding overseas
- **Creating new products** - innovating (developing existing ideas or improving products/services) or R&D for new products not currently for commercial use

Internal growth occurs when a business expands by itself, by bringing out new products or entering new markets.

## External Growth (Inorganic Growth)

A faster way for a business to grow is to join forces with another company. There are 2 approaches:
- **Merger (friendly)** - where two or more businesses voluntarily agree to join into one bigger one (mutual agreement)
- **Takeover (aggressive)** - where one business buys another. To take over a company it's necessary to gain control by buying enough shares
