The colour palette creates meaning, with the soft shades throughout the video signifying a positive mood. For example, the pink sky connotes hope and optimism, and the gold used to highlight the bones of Stormzy and the boy when they appear translucent reflects the lyrics about courage and inner strength.

The iconography used in the video is associated with Black empowerment. The placards and raised fists in the protest scene send a message of Black power. Then, the symbolism at the end of the video when Stormzy places the world in the boy’s hands before leaving him sends a clear message of optimism for the ‘young Black kings’ and ‘young Black queens’ who have the power to change the world.

The costumes in the video create meaning for the audience, with Stormzy’s black outfit symbolising Black empowerment. The boy’s Adidas tracksuit was selected by the director to reflect a style similar to the dress code in Stormzy’s Sounds of the Skeng video, adding authenticity and relatability for the young audience.

Subverting music video conventions, Superheroes does not include the artist performing the song. It is entirely narrative based, with Stormzy featuring as a character leading the young boy on a typical hero’s journey, showing him other characters who have found their gifts or superpowers. The lyrics narrate the story throughout, and the visuals contain many cultural references to real people and events from 2020.

Stormzy is shown in the role of the hero, who rescues the young boy when he falls when flying by himself. The ‘young Black kings’ and ‘young Black queens’ could be seen as Proppian heroes, who receive help from Stormzy and other inspirational figures on their journey towards empowerment.

Lighting is used throughout the video to connote power and energy. Lightning flashes, sunlight and stars are used to connote positivity and to reflect superpowers, such as the lighting effects chosen to show Stormzy teleporting to different locations.

Technical codes also create meaning in the video. For example, a low angle shot establishes Stormzy as the hero the first time he meets the boy. The boy is looking up at him from the corner of the frame, positioning the audience to view Stormzy as an inspirational role model.
