The video constructs a linear narrative, by following the Man’s typical daily activities in various locations including the subway, the office and the park. These everyday settings represent the sexism women encounter in their daily lives.

The Man is also shown in more glamorous locations enjoying leisure time on a yacht and a tennis court, reflecting a more luxurious lifestyle associated with wealth and success.

The character of the Man could be described as the false hero, according to Propp’s character roles, as Taylor Swift is ‘unmasked’ as the real hero at the end of the video. This is highlighted by the credits ‘written by’ and ‘directed by’, encouraging the audience to view her as a powerful and successful woman.

Intertextuality also creates layers of meaning in the video. For example, many intertextual references to Swift’s other albums, including the words RED and Reputation that are graffitied on the subway wall.

The costumes and colour palette in the video are important in constructing the character roles in the video, especially that of the Man. The business suit connotes power and status, and the gold Versace shirt he wears on the yacht suggests a glamorous, wealthy lifestyle. The women in the yacht scene all wear yellow bikinis, which objectifies them by taking away any sense of individuality.

Gesture codes create meaning, such as in the scene on the subway where the Man is ‘manspreading’ and flicking cigarette ash onto the woman next to him. Both actions reflect a disregard for others.

Camerawork also creates meaning in the video. The camera tracks the Man throughout and he is usually positioned in the centre of the frame, surrounded by many supporting characters, signifying his power and assumed importance.

Reaction shots from minor characters are used to show Swift’s attitude towards certain male behaviours. For example, the disapproving facial expression of the male crew member on the yacht and the eye roll from Loren Gray, playing the tennis umpire, encourage the audience to share their feelings.

Swift constructs the character of the Man to make a statement about misogyny and male privilege. Men are represented as disrespectful throughout, with the Man engaging in exaggerated versions of several male behaviours which are often criticised in society.

The scene in the office where the Man tosses a crumpled piece of paper and three women try to catch it represents women being subservient, and audiences may draw a parallel with women at a wedding catching a bouquet, desperate to be ‘chosen’.

In the subway scene, the Man is positioned in the centre of the frame and is manspreading (when men sit on public transport with their legs spread, taking up more space than necessary). This represents the arrogant and self obsessed nature of men and highlights an issue which The New York Times has called ‘the bane of many female subway riders’.

The posters on the subway wall highlight hypermasculinity in action movies, and male stereotypes are reinforced in the newspaper the Man is reading, with headlines such as ‘Year’s most eligible CEOs’ and ‘Men we love in sports’.

In the park scene, the Man earns praise for spending a few seconds with his daughter, something that Taylor Swift feels many women do every day with no recognition. This represents the theme of gender inequality which is explored throughout the video.

Throughout the video women are represented as secondary, supporting characters rather than in the starring role, apart from at the end when the real ‘star’ of the video is revealed to be Swift.

In the tennis scene, the Man, after a time shift of 58 years, marries a visibly much younger woman, then pushes cake in her face. This plays on the negative stereotypes of arrogant and ego-driven men. A feminist reading would also highlight the objectification of women in the scene.

Swift is revealed as the director at the end of the tennis scene, directing her male alter-ego to ‘be sexier’ and ‘more likeable’. This highlights the manner in which some male directors in particular speak to female actors.

The Man’s voice is is performed by Dwayne Johnson, a recognisable Hollywood star well known for portraying hypermasculine characters.
