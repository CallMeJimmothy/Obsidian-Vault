Target demographics (age, gender, socioeconomic)  
Films aim for specific audiences to maximise success  
Couple of examples are:
- teens and young adults for action and spectacle
- older audiences for nostalgia (e.g. long-time Bond fans)
- different genders, with Bond films now including stronger female roles
- global audiences across different social classes

Uses & Gratifications theory: why people watch films (escapism, identity, entertainment, social)  
Audiences consume films for different personal needs  
Couple of ways are:
- escapism from everyday life through action and fantasy
- identity, relating to characters or themes
- entertainment value, thrills and spectacle
- social interaction, giving people something to talk about

Audience reception: preferred, negotiated, oppositional readings  
Not all audiences read films the same way  
Couple of responses are:
- preferred: fans agree with intended meanings and enjoy the film
- negotiated: audiences like some parts but question others
- oppositional: reject the filmâ€™s values, find it problematic or outdated

Fan culture / fandom and engagement  
Fans often go beyond watching by engaging with the film world  
Couple of examples are:
- online forums and social media discussion
- creating fan art, edits, or theories
- cosplay and conventions
- long-term loyalty to a franchise like Bond

Audience habits: streaming vs cinema, bingeing  
Modern audiences consume films in different ways  
Couple of examples are:
- cinema trips for blockbuster spectacle
- streaming platforms for convenience at home
- binge-watching franchises or related films in a row
- mixing both, depending on lifestyle and access
