## Theory Overview

**Uses and Gratifications Theory** suggests that audiences are **active** rather than passive - they actively choose media to satisfy specific needs and desires.

The theory asks: **"What do people do with media?"** rather than "What does media do to people?"

## Four Key Gratifications

### 1. Personal Identity
**How media helps us define ourselves and reinforce our values**

#### Application to Fortnite:

  - Players purchase cosmetic items (skins, emotes, dances)
  - Express individuality through character appearance
  - No gameplay advantage - purely about identity
  
- **Skill and achievement**:
  - Players define themselves as "skilled gamers"
  - Last-player-standing creates sense of accomplishment
  - Ranking systems and statistics track performance
  
- **Community membership**:
  - Being part of gaming culture
  - Identifying as a "Fortnite player"
  - Participation in global gaming community (25% of world population)
