- Cultural context (social norms, gender roles, race, politics)
- Technological context (advances in CGI, streaming)
- Economic context (global box office markets, budgets)
- Genre context: expectations of spy / action films, franchise environment

Cultural context (social norms, gender roles, race, politics)
Films are shaped by the culture at the time.  
Couple of ways this shows up is:
- gender roles changing (e.g. female 00 agent in _No Time to Die_)
- representation of race and diversity becoming more important    
- political climate (terrorism, espionage, international relations)
- social values like equality, identity, and inclusivity
- Technological context (advances in CGI, streaming)

Films rely on new technology to attract audiences.  
Couple of examples are:
- CGI and VFX make stunts, explosions, and worlds more realistic
- streaming services create new distribution channels
- digital cameras and editing improve quality and lower costs
- IMAX and 4DX give cinema-only experiences to compete with streaming

Economic context (global box office markets, budgets)**
Films are influenced by financial conditions and profit goals.  
Couple of ways this matters is:
- high budgets mean high risks (e.g. _No Time to Die_ cost $250–301m)
- global box office is crucial for returns (China, US, Europe)
- merchandise and product placement bring in extra revenue
- economic downturns or pandemics affect cinema attendance

Genre context (expectations of spy / action films, franchise environment)
Films must meet audience expectations of their genre.  
Couple of examples are:
- spy films include exotic locations, gadgets, villains, car chases
- action films need guns, explosions, and high stakes
- Bond films follow franchise “codes” (007 logo, Aston Martin, theme song)
- audiences expect continuity but also some modern twists
