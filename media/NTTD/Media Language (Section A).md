Todorov's Theory of Equilibrium:
- Equilibrium: The initial state of balance, normality, and peace in the story world.
- Disruption: An event that shatters the equilibrium and sets the main plot in motion.
- Recognition: The point where the characters become aware of the disruption.
- Repair: The journey and efforts undertaken by the characters to restore order and fix the disruption.
- New Equilibrium: The resolution, where balance is restored, but it is different from the beginning, as the characters and world have been changed by the events.
