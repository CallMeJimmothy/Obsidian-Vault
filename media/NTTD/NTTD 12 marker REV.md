Films have many different ways of generating money for their producers, and big franchises such as _No Time to Die_ use several strategies to maximise profits.

One of the most important ways is through **box office sales**. When a film is released in cinemas worldwide, ticket sales are split between the cinemas, distributors, and producers. For example, _No Time to Die_ grossed over $774 million at the global box office, which provided a large return on its estimated $250â€“301 million budget. The international audience is crucial, with markets like the US, Europe, and Asia adding significantly to profits.

Another way is **sponsorships and product placement**. Companies pay to have their products featured in the film or linked to marketing campaigns. _No Time to Die_ included partnerships with brands such as Aston Martin, Omega watches, and Heineken, all of which brought in additional revenue before the film even reached cinemas. These deals lower financial risk for producers.

Films also make money from **home media sales**, which continue after the cinema release. This includes DVD, Blu-ray, and digital downloads. In addition, licensing to streaming services like Amazon Prime generates long-term revenue. _No Time to Die_ was later made available on Amazon, ensuring it reached audiences who missed it at the cinema.

Finally, some films can use **alternative financing methods** such as crowdfunding or pre-sales, where rights to distribute the film in certain countries are sold before release. While this is more common in smaller independent films, it highlights how producers secure income in advance.

In conclusion, films earn money through multiple sources, not just cinema tickets. _No Time to Die_ shows how producers combine box office sales, sponsorships, home media, and streaming rights to cover huge budgets and generate profit. This multi-channel approach is vital for blockbuster films with high production costs.
