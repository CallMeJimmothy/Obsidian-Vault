There are many differences these two selected media products as for they are both film posters containing the same genre of movie. The two posters are TMWTGG (The Man With The Golden Gun) and Spy -- for which presumably they fall under the action spy genre -- both representing men in their own unique way.

In TMWTGG Men are seen as a superior or more relevant gender within the film so to speak. This is presented through James Bond being the main protagonist (007) while other characters such as the Bond girls within the series are shown to be inferior in all but one aspect, shown through the positioning and the clothes in which is worn in the poster, centre being 007 and there two girls on either side of the poster in bikini's while 007 stands in a wide stance (powerful). Presenting 007 as the powerful figure and main protagonist of the show, with the two girls only acting as part of the male gaze, coined by Laura Mulvey to call out the way women are portrayed in media as to only be there for a males "eye candy".

Within the Spy poster it is clear that there is a difference in the interpretations of the male figure. As a female now stands as the centre of interest while two men stand by side as if they where bodyguards. To predominantly show that men are of lower status than the female protagonist such as to be side characters (props theory). All of them wearing a more formal attire as such to be clear that they are on an equal standing with each other.

There are some similarities with both these posters in which that they portray the societal norms of the time period the films were made in, TMWTGG is clear to be a more olden film embracing the beliefs held in a Patriarchal society  and Spy holding a more appeal to those audiences which would most likely share the same values we hold in the current day.

The representation of men between these two posters is clearly a parallel to the political beliefs such as communism and capitalism, as to say the two film posters represent the male individual in such contrasting lights.
